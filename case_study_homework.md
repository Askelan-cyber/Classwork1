## Overview and Origin

* Name of company
-*Staked*
* When was the company incorporated?
-*April 2018*

* Who are the founders of the company?
-*Tim Ogilvie, Seth Riney, Jonathan Marcus*

* How did the idea for the company (or project) come about?
-*As a growing shift in the crytocurrency and blockchain technology market moves to Proof of Stake, rather than Proof of Work, Staked provides institutional investors a non-custodial ability to stake though a technical infrastructure. The idea was born beacause many holders of PoS currency would be massively interested in earning a yield on funds that they hold, similar to how banks provide interest on cash deposits.*  

* How is the company funded? How much funding have they received?
-*Staked was funded in a seed round by by Pantera Captial for $4.5M dollars. Other investors in this seed fund include Coinbase Ventures, Global Brain, Digital Currency Group, Winklevoss Capital, Fabric Ventures and Blocktree Capital.*

## Business Activities:

* What specific financial problem is the company or project trying to solve?
-*Staked is providing institutional lenders the capacity to stake or lend their holdings in PoS cyrptocurrencies. It requires a large base of secure of vacant servers which the company is providing* 

* Who is the company's intended customer?  Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers?
What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer? (What is the unfair advantage they utilize?)
-*Currently the company's intended customers are large instituional investors. By having a large volume of available AND secure servers, they are able to compete in a space where smaller startups would not be able to enter. This secure infrastructure is their advantage.* 

* Which technologies are they currently using, and how are they implementing them? (This may take a little bit of sleuthing–– you may want to search the company’s engineering blog or use sites like Stackshare to find this information.)
-*They use standard blockchain proof of stake technology, the edge utilized is hardware not software. Proof of stake technology is a way of defining the next valid block in any blockchain. Rather than solving complex mathematical puzzles, PoS utilizes the amount of coins held by someone staking and compares that in proportion to transactions. This technology is far superior to PoW as it is less risky to malicious threats, and doesn't require the huge amounts of energy that PoW does.*


## Landscape:

* What domain of the financial industry is the company in?
-*Blockchain Technology*

* What have been the major trends and innovations of this domain over the last 5-10 years?
-*This domain has just made it to the 10 year mark, and a massive industry trend is participation in general, and a move from proof of work toward proof of stake technology.*
* What are the other major companies in this domain?
-*Stake Capital, Stake.Fish, Stakinglab, Staking Facilities*


## Results

* What has been the business impact of this company so far?
-*This company is still in the seed funding status, as it continues to expand its institutional client base. By offering large players a new way to earn such a enticing yields, it will continue to grow in my opinion*

* What are some of the core metrics that companies in this domain use to measure success? How is your company performing, based on these metrics?
-*Currently those metrics would be the size and the quantity of the instituitional investors being brough it, which it has done quite a remarkable job of. They are already working with several big names in the industry, and have gained tremendous success in a short period of time since starting, however that growth has seemed to slow down since launch*

* How is your company performing relative to competitors in the same domain?
-*It is one of the largest companies amongst it's competitos currently, charging the lowest fees*


## Recommendations

* If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer? (This could be something that a competitor offers, or use your imagination!)
-*I would strongly recommend them to open their platform to noninstitutional investors. By tapping this market, they could accelerate their growth model, by acquiring numerous smaller customers at volume, rather than waiting to catch a few big fish.*

* Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company?
-*It is a far better use of cash deposits in the form of crytpcurrencies. The yields offer outperform all sorts of tranditional investing. By offering their service to the general public, they could expand much quicker*

* What technologies would this additional product or service utilize?
-*They would need to build much more secure infrastructure, and eleiminate the non-custodial element in their strategy*

* Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution?
-*They are simply required to scale the service offerings to a much larger population*
